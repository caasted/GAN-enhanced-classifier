# electric-sheep
Enhanced image classification through the application of generative adversarial networks (GANs).

## Installation
Running the code in this project requires the installation of the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/#installation) libraries. Please see the linked webpages for instructions on installing the required dependencies and configuring your system for their use. Some of the analysis is also performed using [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/install.html), which the developer's website recommends you install via [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

## Report
The [capstone project report](https://github.com/caasted/electric-sheep/blob/master/MLND%20Capstone%20Report.pdf) I have prepared for the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree at Udacity is also available as a narrative explanation of this code at the time of the completion of that program.

## Files
The generative adversarial networks (GANs) developed for this project are contained in the folder "GAN-Mode3."" Two benchmark classifiers are available in the folders "reg-Mode2" and "reg-Mode1n." Ongoing work on a multi-class conditional GAN is available in the folder "GAN-Mode2n."
